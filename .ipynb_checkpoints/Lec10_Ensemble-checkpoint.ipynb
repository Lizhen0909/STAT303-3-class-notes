    "Ensembling models can help reduce error by leveraging the diversity and collective wisdom of multiple models. When ensembling, several individual models are trained independently and their predictions are combined to make the final prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have already seen examples of ensemble models in chapters 5 - 13. The ensembled models may reduce error by reducing the bias *(boosting)* and / or reducing the variance *(bagging / random forests / boosting)*.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, in this chapter we'll ensemble different types of models, instead of the same type of model. We may ensemble a linear regression model, a random forest, a gradient boosting model, and as many different types of models as we wish. \n",
    "\n",
    "Below are a couple of reasons why ensembling models can be effective in reducing error:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Bias reduction:** Different models may have different biases and the ensemble can help mitigate the individual biases, leading to a more generalized and accurate prediction. For example, consider that one model has a positive bias, and another model has a negative bias for the same instance. By averaging or combining the predictions of the two models, the biases may cancel out.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Variance reduction:** As seen in the case of random forests and bagged trees, by averaging or combining the predictions of multiple models, the ensemble can reduce the overall variance and improve the accuracy of the final prediction. Note that for variance reduction, the models should have a low correlation *(recall the variance reduction formula of random forests)*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematically also, we can show the effectiveness of an ensemble model. Let's consider the case of regression, and let the predictors be denoted as $X$, and the response as $Y$. Let $f_1, ..., f_m$ be individual models. The expected MSE of an ensemble can be written as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ E(MSE_{Ensemble}) = E\\bigg[\\bigg( \\frac{1}{m} \\sum_{i = 1}^{m} f_i(X) - Y \\bigg)^2 \\bigg] = \\frac{1}{m^2} \\sum_{i = 1}^{m} E \\bigg[\\big(f_i(X) - Y\\big)^2 \\bigg] + \\frac{1}{m^2} \\sum_{i \\ne j} E\\bigg[\\big(f_i(X) - Y\\big)\\big(f_j(X) - Y\\big) \\bigg]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\implies E(MSE_{Ensemble}) = \\frac{1}{m}\\bigg(\\frac{1}{m} \\sum_{i=1}^m E \\bigg[\\big(f_i(X) - Y\\big)^2 \\bigg]\\bigg) + \\frac{1}{m^2} \\sum_{i \\ne j} E\\bigg[\\big(f_i(X) - Y\\big)\\big(f_j(X) - Y\\big) \\bigg]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\implies E(MSE_{Ensemble}) = \\frac{1}{m}\\bigg(\\frac{1}{m} \\sum_{i=1}^m MSE_{f_i}\\bigg) + \\frac{1}{m^2} \\sum_{i \\ne j} E\\bigg[\\big(f_i(X) - Y\\big)\\big(f_j(X) - Y\\big) \\bigg]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "If $f_1, ..., f_m$ are unbiased, then,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ E(MSE_{Ensemble}) = \\frac{1}{m}\\bigg(\\frac{1}{m} \\sum_{i=1}^m MSE_{f_i}\\bigg) + \\frac{1}{m^2} \\sum_{i \\ne j} Cov(f_i(X), f_j(X))$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Assuming the **models are uncorrelated** *(i.e., they have a zero correlation)*, the second term *(covariance of $f_i(.)$ and $f_j(.)$)* reduces to zero, and the expected MSE of the ensemble reduces to:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "MSE_{Ensemble} = \\frac{1}{m}\\bigg(\\frac{1}{m} \\sum_{i=1}^m MSE_{f_i}\\bigg)\n",
    "$$ {#eq-ensemble}\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, the expected MSE of an ensemble model with uncorrelated models is much smaller than the average MSE of all the models. Unless there is a model that is much better than the rest of the models, the MSE of the ensemble model is likely to be lower than the MSE of the individual models. However, there is no guarantee that the MSE of the ensemble model will be lower than the MSE of the individual models. Consider an extreme case where only one of the models have a zero MSE. The MSE of this model will be lower than the expected MSE of the ensemble model."

Thus, sometimes, the weaker models, despite bringing-in diversity in the model ensemble may deteriorate the ensemble accuracy due to their poor individual performace *(check sldies for technical details)*. Thus, sometimes, another approach to bring in model diversity is to develop strong models based on different sets of predictors, and ensemble them.\n",
