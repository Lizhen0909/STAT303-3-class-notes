# Preface {.unnumbered}

These are class notes for the course STAT303-3. This is not the course text-book. You are required to read the relevant sections of the book as mentioned on the course website. 

The course notes are currently being written, and will continue to being developed as the course progresses (just like the class notes last quarter). Please report any typos / mistakes / inconsistencies / issues with the class notes / class presentations in your comments [here](https://campuswire.com/c/G4A02E28A). Thank you!
