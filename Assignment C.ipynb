    "4. Use [Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/html-basics.html) to print the *.ipynb* file as HTML. You will need to open the command prompt, navigate to the directory containing the file, and use the command: `quarto render filename.ipynb --to html`. Submit the HTML file.\n",

    "- Must be an HTML file rendered using Quarto (1 pt). *If you have a Quarto issue, you must mention the issue & quote the error you get when rendering using Quarto in the comments section of Canvas, and submit the ipynb file.* \n",
    "- No name can be written on the assignment, nor can there be any indicator of the student’s identity—e.g. printouts of the working directory should not be included in the final submission  (1 pt)\n",
    "- There aren’t excessively long outputs of extraneous information (e.g. no printouts of entire data frames without good reason, there aren’t long printouts of which iteration a loop is on, there aren’t long sections of commented-out code, etc.) (1 pt)\n",
    "- Final answers of each question are written in Markdown cells (1 pt).\n",
    "- There is no piece of unnecessary / redundant code, and no unnecessary / redundant text (1 pt)"
