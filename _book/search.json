You can access Jupyter notebook from the Anaconda Navigator, or directly open the Jupyter Notebook application itself. It should automatically open up in your default browser. The figure below shows a Jupyter Notebook opened with Google Chrome. This page is called the landing page of the notebook.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo create a new notebook, click on the New button and select the Python 3 option. You should see a blank notebook as in the figure below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.2.2 Writing and executing code\nCode cell: By default, a cell is of type Code, i.e., for typing code, as seen as the default choice in the dropdown menu below the Widgets tab. Try typing a line of python code (say, 2+3) in an empty code cell and execute it by pressing Shift+Enter. This should execute the code, and create an new code cell. Pressing Ctlr+Enter for Windows (or Cmd+Enter for Mac) will execute the code without creating a new cell.\nCommenting code in a code cell: Comments should be made while writing the code to explain the purpose of the code or a brief explanation of the tasks being performed by the code. A comment can be added in a code cell by preceding it with a # sign. For example, see the comment in the code below.\nWriting comments will help other users understand your code. It is also useful for the coder to keep track of the tasks being performed by their code.\n\n#This code adds 3 and 5\n3+5\n\n8\n\n\nMarkdown cell: Although a comment can be written in a code cell, a code cell cannot be used for writing headings/sub-headings, and is not appropriate for writing lengthy chunks of text. In such cases, change the cell type to Markdown from the dropdown menu below the Widgets tab. Use any markdown cheat sheet found online, for example, this one to format text in the markdown cells.\nGive a name to the notebook by clicking on the text, which says ‘Untitled’.\n\n\n1.2.3 Saving and loading notebooks\nSave the notebook by clicking on File, and selecting Save as, or clicking on the Save and Checkpoint icon (below the File tab). Your notebook will be saved as a file with an exptension ipynb. This file will contain all the code as well as the outputs, and can be loaded and edited by a Jupyter user. To load an existing Jupyter notebook, navigate to the folder of the notebook on the landing page, and then click on the file to open it.\n\n\n1.2.4 Rendering notebook as HTML\nWe’ll use Quarto to print the **.ipynb* file as HTML. Check the procedure for rendering a notebook as HTML here. You have several options to format the file.\nYou will need to open the command prompt, navigate to the directory containing the file, and use the command: quarto render filename.ipynb --to html."

    "text": "1.4 Python libraries\nThere are several built-in functions in python like print(), abs(), max(), sum() etc., which do not require importing any library. However, these functions will typically be insufficient for a analyzing data. Some of the popular libraries in data science and their primary purposes are as follows:\n\nNumPy: Performing numerical operations and efficiently storing numerical data.\nPandas: Reading, cleaning and manipulating data.\nMatplotlib, Seaborn: Visualizing data.\nSciPy: Performing scientific computing such as solving differential equations, optimization, statistical tests, etc.\nScikit-learn: Data pre-processing and machine learning, with a focus on prediction.\nStatsmodels: Developing statistical models with a focus on inference\n\nA library can be imported using the import keyword. For example, a NumPy library can be imported as:\n\nimport numpy as np\n\nUsing the as keyboard, the NumPy library has been given the name np. All the functions and attributes of the library can be called using the ‘np.’ prefix. For example, let us generate a sequence of whole numbers upto 10 using the NumPy function arange():\n\nnp.arange(8)\n\narray([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7])\n\n\nGenerating random numbers is very useful in python for performing simulations (we’ll see in later chapters). The library random is used to generate random numbers such as integers, real numbers based on different probability distributions, etc.\nBelow is an example of using the randint() function of the library for generating random numbers in [a, b], where a and b are integers.\n\nimport random as rm\nrm.randint(5,10) #This will generate a random number in [5,10]\n\n7"

However, the value of x can be changed:\n\nx = 3\nprint(\"x =\", x)\n\nx = 3\n\n\nThus, the object x in the above code is a variable that refers to a memory location storing the constant value of 3.\n\n2.2.1 Variable names\nThere are a some rules for naming variables:\n\nA variable name must start with a letter or underscore _\nA variable name may consist of letters, numbers, and underscores only\n\nFor example, some of the valid variable names are *salary, text10, _varname. Some of the invalid variable names are salary% 10text, varname)*\n\nVariable names are case-sensitive.

These reserved words are:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBest coding practice: Variables should be named such that they are informative of the value they are storing. For example, suppose we wish to compute the income tax a person has to pay based on their income and tax rate. Below are two ways of naming variables to do this computation:\n\nincome = 80000\ntax_rate = 0.15\nprint(\"Income tax = \",income*tax_rate)\n\nIncome tax =  12000.0\n\n\n\na = 80000\nb = 0.15\nprint(\"Income tax = \",a*b)\n\nIncome tax =  12000.0\n\n\nThe former code chuck is better than the latter one as it makes the code easy to read and understand.\n\n\n2.2.2 Practice exercise 2\n\n2.2.2.1 \nIn the statements below, classify the objects as variables or constants: 1. value = “name” 2. constant = 7 3. another_const = “variable” 4.

We cannot use the variable monthly_income directly as its datatype is a string and not a number. Thus, numerical operations cannnot be performed on the variable annual_income.\nWe’ll need to convert annual_income to an integer. For that we will use the python’s in-built int() function:\n\nannual_income = int(annual_income)\nmonthly_income = annual_income/12\nprint(\"monthly income = \", monthly_income)\n\nmonthly income =  6666.666666666667\n\n\nSimilarly, datatypes can be converted from one type to another using in-built python functions as shown below:\n\n#Converting integer to string\nstr(9)\n\n'9'\n\n\n\n#Converting string to float\nfloat(\"4.5\")\n\n4.5\n\n\n\n#Converting bool to integer\nint(True)\n\n1\n\n\nSometimes, conversion of a value may not be possible. For example, it is not possible to convert the variable greeting defined below to a number:\n\ngreeting = \"hello\"\n\nHowever, in some cases, mathematical operators such as + and * can be applied on strings. The operator + concatenates multiple strings, while the operator * can be used to concatenate a string to itself multiple times:\n\n\"Hi\" + \" there!\"\n\n'Hi there!'\n\n\n\n\"5\" + '3'\n\n'53'\n\n\n\n\"5\"*8\n\n'55555555'"

    "text": "2.8 Programming errors\nThere are 3 types of errors that can occur in a program - syntax errors, run-time errors, and semantic errors.\n\n2.8.1 Syntax errors\nSyntax errors occur if the code is written in a way that it does not comply with the rules / standards / laws of the language (python in this case). For example, suppose a values is assigned to a variable as follows:\n\n9value = 2\n\nThe above code when executed will indicate a syntax error as it violates the rule that a varible name must not start with a number.\n\n\n2.8.2 Run-time errors\nRun-time errors occur when a code is syntactically correct, but there are other issues with the code such as:\n\nMisspelled or incorrectly capitalized variable and function names\nAttempts to perform operations (such as math operations) on data of the wrong type (ex. attempting to subtract two variables that hold string values)\nDividing by zero\nAttempts to use a type conversion function such as int on a value that can’t be converted to an int\n\nFor example, suppose a number is multipled as follws:\n\nmultiplication_result = x * 4\n\nThe above code is syntactically correct. However, it will generate an error as the variable x has not been defined as a number.\n\n\n2.8.3 Semantic errors\nSemantic errors occur when the code executes without an error being indicated by the compiler. However, it does not work as inteded by the user. For example, consider the following code of mutiplying the number 6 by 3:\n\nx = '6'\nx * 3\n\n'666'\n\n\nIf it was intended to multiply the number 6, then the variable x should have been defined as x=6 so that x has a value of type integer. However, in the above code 6 is a string type value. When a string is multiplied by an integer, say n, it concatenates with itself n times.\n\n\n2.8.4 Practice exercise 6\nSuppose we wish to compute tax using the income and the tax rate. Identify the type of error from amongst syntax error, semantic error and run-time error in the following pieces of code.\n\nincome = 2000\ntax = .08 * Income\nprint(\"tax on\", income, \"is:\", tax)\n\n\nincome = 2000\ntax = .08 x income\nprint(\"tax on\", income, \"is:\", tax)\n\n\nincome = 2000\ntax = .08 ** income\nprint(\"tax on\", income, \"is:\", tax)\n\nThe errors from top to bottom are:\n\nRun-time error (The variable Income is not defined)\nSyntax error (Here x is not interpretable for the python compiler. Thus, the code does not comply with the rules of the language)\nSemantic error (Instead of multiplying the income by tax rate, the tax rate is raised to the power of income. The code works but not as intended)."

This statement helps with conditional execution of code, i.e., the piece of code to be executed is selected based on certain condition(s).\n\n3.1.1 Comparison operators\nFor testing if conditions are true or false, first we need to learn the opeartors that can be used for comparison. For example, suppose we want to check if two objects are equal, we use the == operator:\n\n5==6\n\nFalse\n\n\n\nx = \"hi\"\ny = \"hi\"\nx==y\n\nTrue\n\n\nBelow are the python comparison operators and their meanings.\n\n\n\nPython code\nMeaning\n\n\n\n\nx==y\nProduce True if … x is equal to y\n\n\nx != y\n… x is not equal to y\n\n\nx > y\n… x is greater than y\n\n\nx < y\n… x is less than y\n\n\nx >= y\n… x is greater than or equal to y\n\n\nx <= y\n… x is less than or equal to y\n\n\n\n\n\n3.1.2 Logical operators\nSometimes we may need to check multiple conditions simultaneously. The logical operator and is used to check if all the conditions are true, while the logical operator or is used to check if either of the conditons is true.\n\n#Checking if both the conditions are true using 'and'\n5==5 and 67==68\n\nFalse\n\n\n\n#Checking if either condition is true using 'or'\nx = 6; y = 90\nx<0 or y>50\n\nTrue\n\n\n\n\n3.1.3 if-elif-else statement\nThe if-elif-else statements can check several conditions, and execute the code corresponding to the condition that is true. Note that there can be as many elif statements as required.\nSyntax: Python uses indentation to identify the code to be executed if a condition is true. All the code indented within a condition is executed if the condition is true.\nExample: Input an integer. Print whether it is positive or negative.\n\nnumber = input(\"Enter a number:\")  #Input an integer\nnumber_integer = int(number)       #Convert the integer to 'int' datatype\nif number_integer>0:               #Check if the integer is positive\n    print(\"Number is positive\")\nelse:\n    print(\"Number is negative\")\n\nEnter a number:-9\nNumber is negative\n\n\nIn the above code, note that anything entered by the user is taken as a string datatype by python. However, a string cannot be positive or negative. So, we converted the number input by the user to integer to check if it was positive or negative.\nThere may be multiple statements to be executed if a condition is true. See the example below.\nExample: Input a number. Print whether it is positive, negative or zero. If it is negative, print its absolute value.\n\nnumber = input(\"Enter a number:\")\nnumber_integer = int(number)\nif number_integer>0:\n    print(\"Number is positive\")\nelif number_integer==0:\n    print(\"Number is zero\")\nelse:\n    print(\"Number is negative\")\n    print(\"Absolute value of number = \", abs(number_integer))\n\nEnter a number:0\nNumber is zero\n\n\n\n\n3.1.4 Practice exercise 1\nInput a number. Print whether its odd or even.\nSolution:\n\nnum = int(input(\"Enter a number: \"))\nif num%2==0:           #Checking if the number is divisible by 2\n    print(\"Number is even\")\nelse:\n    print(\"Number is odd\")\n\nEnter a number: 5\nNumber is odd\n\n\n\n\n3.1.5 Try-except\nIf we suspect that some lines of code may produce an error, we can put them in a try block, and if an error does occur, we can use the except block to instead execute an alternative piece of code. This way the program will not stop if an error occurs within the try block, and instead will be directed to execute the code within the except block.\nExample: Input an integer from the user.

    "text": "3.2 Loops\nWith loops, a piece of code can be executed repeatedly for a fixed number of times or until a condition is satistified.\n\n3.2.1 for loop\nWith a for loop, a piece of code is executed a fixed number of times.\nWe typically use for loops with an in-built python function called range() that supports for loops. Below is its description.\nrange(): The range() function returns a sequence of evenly-spaced integer values. It is commonly used in for loops to define the sequence of elements over which the iterations are performed.\nBelow is an example where the range() function is used to create a sequence of whole numbers upto 10. Ignore the list() function in the code below, as it will be introduced later.\n\nprint(list(range(10)))\n\n[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]\n\n\nNote that the last element is one less than the integer specified in the range() function.\nUsing the range() function, the for loop can iterate over a sequence of numbers. See the example below.\nExample: Print the first n elements of the Fibonacci sequence, where n is an integer input by the user, such that n>2. In a fibonacci sequence, each number is the sum of the preceding two numbers, and the sequence starts from 0,1. The sequence is as follows:\n0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13,….\n\nn=int(input(\"Enter number of elements:\"))\n\n#Initializing the sequence to start from 0, 1\nn1=0;n2=1\n\n#Printing the first two numbers of the sequence\nprint(n1)\nprint(n2)\n\nfor i in range(n-2):  #Since two numbers of the sequence are already printed, n-2 numbers are required\n    \n    #Computing the next number of the sequence as the summation of the previous two numbers\n    n3 = n1+n2\n    print(n3)\n    \n    #As 'n3' is already printed, it is no longer the next number of the sequence. \n    #Thus, we move the values of the variables n1 and n2 one place to the right to compute the next number of the sequence.\n    n1 = n2\n    n2 = n3  \n    \nprint(\"These are the first\", n, \"elements of the fibonacci series\")\n\nEnter number of elements:6\n0\n1\n1\n2\n3\n5\nThese are the first 6 elements of the fibonacci series\n\n\nAs in the if-elif-else statement, the for loop uses identation to indicate the piece of code to be run repeatedly.\nNote that we have used an in-built python function\n\n\n3.2.2 while loop\nWith a while loops, a piece of code is executed repeatedly until certain condition(s) hold.\nExample: Print all the elements of the Fibonacci sequence less than n, where n is an integer input by the user, such that n>2.

As an analogy, if a human is a computer program, then the mind can be considered to be a function, which has purpose of thinking, eyes can be another function, which have a purpose of seeing. These functions are called upon by the human when needed.\nSimilarly, in case of a computer program, functions are a piece of code, that perform a specific task, when called upon by the program. Instead of being defined as a function, the piece of code can also be used directly whenever it is needed in a program. However, defining a frequently-used piece of code as a function has the following benefits:\n\nIt reduces the number of lines of code, as the lines of code need to be written just once in the function definition. Thereafter, the function is called by its name, wherever needed in the program. This makes the code compact, and enhances readability.\nIt makes the process of writing code easier, as the user needs to just type the name of the function, wherever it is needed, instead of pasting lines of code.\nIt can be used in different programs, thereby saving time in writing other programs.\n\nTo put it more formally, a function is a piece of code that takes arguments (if any) as input, performs computations or tasks, and then returns a result or results."

When a function is called, the value(s) of these parameter(s) must be specified as argument(s) to the function.\n\n4.3.1 Function with a parameter\nLet us change the previous example to write a function that takes an integer as an input argument, and prints whether it is odd or even:\n\n#This is an example of a function definition that has an argument\ndef odd_even(num):           \n    if num%2==0:\n        print(\"Even\")\n    else:\n        print(\"Odd\")\n\nWe can use the function whenever we wish to find a number is odd or even.

    "text": "4.6 Built-in python functions\nSo far we have seen user-defined functions in this chapter. These functions were defined by us, and are not stored permanently in the python compiler. However, there are some functions that come built-in with python and we can use them directly without defining them. These built-in functions can be see here. For example the built-in function max() computes the max of numeric values:\n\nmax(1,2,3)\n\n3\n\n\nAnother example is the round() function that rounds up floating point numbers:\n\nround(3.7)\n\n4"

    "text": "4.7 Python libraries\nOther than the built-in functions, python has hundreds of thousands of libraries that contain several useful functions. These libraries are contributed by people around the world as python is an open-source platform. Some of the libraries popular in data science, and their purposes are the following:\n\nNumPy: Performing numerical operations and efficiently storing numerical data.\nPandas: Reading, cleaning and manipulating data.\nMatplotlib, Seaborn: Visualizing data.\nSciPy: Performing scientific computing such as solving differential equations, optimization, statistical tests, etc.\nScikit-learn: Data pre-processing and machine learning, with a focus on prediction.\nStatsmodels: Developing statistical models with a focus on inference\n\nA library can be imported using the import keyword. For example, a NumPy library can be imported as:\n\nimport numpy as np\n\nUsing the as keyboard, the NumPy library has been given the name np. All the functions and attributes of the library can be called using the ‘np.’ prefix. For example, let us generate a sequence of whole numbers upto 10 using the NumPy function arange():\n\nnp.arange(8)\n\narray([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7])\n\n\nGenerating random numbers is very useful in python for performing simulations (we’ll see in later chapters). The library random is used to generate random numbers such as integers, real numbers based on different probability distributions, etc.\nBelow is an example of using the randint() function of the library for generating random numbers in [a, b], where a and b are integers.\n\nimport random as rm\nrm.randint(5,10) #This will generate a random number in [5,10]\n\n7\n\n\n\n4.7.1 Practice exercise 2\nGenerate a random number between [-5,5]. Do this 10,000 times. Find the mean of all the 10,000 random numbers generated.\nSolution:\n\nimport random as rm\ncounter = 0\nfor i in range(10000):\n    counter = counter + rm.uniform(-5,5)\nprint(\"Mean is:\", counter/10000)\n\nMean is: 0.061433810226516616"

For example, below is a tuple containing three integers.\n\ntuple_example = (2,7,4)\n\nWe can check the data type of a python object using the type() function. Let us check the data type of the object tuple_example.\n\ntype(tuple_example)\n\ntuple\n\n\nElements of a tuple can be extracted using their index within square brackets. For example the second element of the tuple tuple_example can be extracted as follows:\n\ntuple_example[1]\n\n7\n\n\nNote that an element of a tuple cannot be modified. For example, consider the following attempt in changing the second element of the tuple tuple_example.\n\ntuple_example[1] = 8\n\nTypeError: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment\n\n\nThe above code results in an error as tuple elements cannot be modified.\n\n5.1.1 Practice exercise 1\nUSA’s GDP per capita from 1960 to 2021 is given by the tuple T in the code cell below.

    "text": "5.2 List\nList is a sequence of python objects, with two key characeterisics that differentiates it from tuple: (1) the number of objects are variable, i.e., objects can be added or removed from a list, and (2) the objects are mutable, i.e., they can be changed.\nList can be defined as a sequence of python objects separated by commas, and enclosed in square brackets []. For example, below is a list consisting of three integers.\n\nlist_example = [2,7,4]\n\n\n5.2.1 Adding and removing elements in a list\nWe can add elements at the end of the list using the append method. For example, we append the string ‘red’ to the list list_example below.\n\nlist_example.append('red')\n\n\nlist_example\n\n[2, 7, 4, 'red']\n\n\nNote that the objects of a list or a tuple can be of different datatypes.\nAn element can be added at a specific location of the list using the insert method. For example, if we wish to insert the number 2.32 as the second element of the list list_example, we can do it as follows:\n\nlist_example.insert(1,2.32)\n\n\nlist_example\n\n[2, 2.32, 7, 4, 'red']\n\n\nFor removing an element from the list, the pop and remove methods may be used. The pop method removes an element at a particular index, while the remove method removes the element’s first occurence in the list by its value. See the examples below.\nLet us say, we need to remove the third element of the list.\n\nlist_example.pop(2)\n\n7\n\n\n\nlist_example\n\n[2, 2.32, 4, 'red']\n\n\nLet us say, we need to remove the element ‘red’.\n\nlist_example.remove('red')\n\n\nlist_example\n\n[2, 2.32, 4]\n\n\n\n#If there are multiple occurences of an element in the list, the first occurence will be removed\nlist_example2 = [2,3,2,4,4]\nlist_example2.remove(2)\nlist_example2\n\n[3, 2, 4, 4]\n\n\nFor removing multiple elements in a list, either pop or remove can be used in a for loop, or a for loop can be used with a condition. See the examples below.\nLet’s say we need to remove integers less than 100 from the following list.\n\nlist_example3 = list(range(95,106))\nlist_example3\n\n[95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105]\n\n\n\n#Method 1: For loop with remove\nlist_example3_filtered = list(list_example3) #\nfor element in list_example3:\n    if element<100:\n        list_example3_filtered.remove(element)\nprint(list_example3_filtered)\n\n[100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105]\n\n\n\\(\\color{red}{\\text{Q1}}\\): What’s the need to define a new variable list\\_example3\\_filtered in the above code?\n\\(\\color{blue}{\\text{A1}}\\): Replace list_example3_filtered with list_example3 and identify the issue.\n\n#Method 2: For loop with condition\n[element for element in list_example3 if element>100]\n\n[101, 102, 103, 104, 105]\n\n\n\n\n5.2.2 List comprehensions\nList comprehension is a compact way to create new lists based on elements of an existing list or other objects.\nExample: Create a list that has squares of natural numbers from 5 to 15.\n\nsqrt_natural_no_5_15 = [(x**2) for x in range(5,16)]\nprint(sqrt_natural_no_5_15)\n\n[25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100, 121, 144, 169, 196, 225]\n\n\nExample: Create a list of tuples, where each tuple consists of a natural number and its square, for natural numbers ranging from 5 to 15.\n\nsqrt_natural_no_5_15 = [(x,x**2) for x in range(5,16)]\nprint(sqrt_natural_no_5_15)\n\n[(5, 25), (6, 36), (7, 49), (8, 64), (9, 81), (10, 100), (11, 121), (12, 144), (13, 169), (14, 196), (15, 225)]\n\n\n\n\n5.2.3 Practice exercise 3\nBelow is a list consisting of responses to the question: “At what age do you think you will marry?” from students of the STAT303-1 Fall 2022 class.\n\nexp_marriage_age=['24','30','28','29','30','27','26','28','30+','26','28','30','30','30','probably never','30','25','25','30','28','30+ ','30','25','28','28','25','25','27','28','30','30','35','26','28','27','27','30','25','30','26','32','27','26','27','26','28','37','28','28','28','35','28','27','28','26','28','26','30','27','30','28','25','26','28','35','29','27','27','30','24','25','29','27','33','30','30','25','26','30','32','26','30','30','I wont','25','27','27','25','27','27','32','26','25','never','28','33','28','35','25','30','29','30','31','28','28','30','40','30','28','30','27','by 30','28','27','28','30-35','35','30','30','never','30','35','28','31','30','27','33','32','27','27','26','N/A','25','26','29','28','34','26','24','28','30','120','25','33','27','28','32','30','26','30','30','28','27','27','27','27','27','27','28','30','30','30','28','30','28','30','30','28','28','30','27','30','28','25','never','69','28','28','33','30','28','28','26','30','26','27','30','25','Never','27','27','25']\n\nUse list comprehension to:\n\n5.2.3.1 \nRemove the elements that are not integers - such as ‘probably never’, ‘30+’, etc. What is the length of the new list?\nHint: The built-in python function of the str class - isdigit() may be useful to check if the string contains only digits.\n\nexp_marriage_age_num = [x for x in exp_marriage_age if x.isdigit()==True]\nprint(\"Length of the new list = \",len(exp_marriage_age_num))\n\nLength of the new list =  181\n\n\n\n\n5.2.3.2 \nCap the values greater than 80 to 80, in the clean list obtained in (1). What is the mean age when people expect to marry in the new list?\n\nexp_marriage_age_capped = [min(int(x),80) for x in exp_marriage_age_num]\nprint(\"Mean age when people expect to marry = \", sum(exp_marriage_age_capped)/len(exp_marriage_age_capped))\n\nMean age when people expect to marry =  28.955801104972377\n\n\n\n\n5.2.3.3 \nDetermine the percentage of people who expect to marry at an age of 30 or more.\n\nprint(\"Percentage of people who expect to marry at an age of 30 or more =\", str(100*sum([1 for x in exp_marriage_age_capped if x>=30])/len(exp_marriage_age_capped)),\"%\")\n\nPercentage of people who expect to marry at an age of 30 or more = 37.01657458563536 %\n\n\n\n\n\n5.2.4 Concatenating lists\nAs in tuples, lists can be concatenated using the + operator:\n\nimport time as tm\n\n\nlist_example4 = [5,'hi',4] \nlist_example4 = list_example4 + [None,'7',9]\nlist_example4\n\n[5, 'hi', 4, None, '7', 9]\n\n\nFor adding elements to a list, the extend method is preferred over the + operator. This is because the + operator creates a new list, while the extend method adds elements to an existing list. Thus, the extend operator is more memory efficient.\n\nlist_example4 = [5,'hi',4]\nlist_example4.extend([None, '7', 9])\nlist_example4\n\n[5, 'hi', 4, None, '7', 9]\n\n\n\n\n5.2.5 Sorting a list\nA list can be sorted using the sort method:\n\nlist_example5 = [6,78,9]\nlist_example5.sort(reverse=True) #the reverse argument is used to specify if the sorting is in ascending or descending order\nlist_example5\n\n[78, 9, 6]\n\n\n\n\n5.2.6 Slicing a list\nWe may extract or update a section of the list by passing the starting index (say start) and the stopping index (say stop) as start:stop to the index operator []. This is called slicing a list. For example, see the following example.\n\nlist_example6 = [4,7,3,5,7,1,5,87,5]\n\nLet us extract a slice containing all the elements from the the 3rd position to the 7th position.\n\nlist_example6[2:7]\n\n[3, 5, 7, 1, 5]\n\n\nNote that while the element at the start index is included, the element with the stop index is excluded in the above slice.\nIf either the start or stop index is not mentioned, the slicing will be done from the beginning or until the end of the list, respectively.\n\nlist_example6[:7]\n\n[4, 7, 3, 5, 7, 1, 5]\n\n\n\nlist_example6[2:]\n\n[3, 5, 7, 1, 5, 87, 5]\n\n\nTo slice the list relative to the end, we can use negative indices:\n\nlist_example6[-4:]\n\n[1, 5, 87, 5]\n\n\n\nlist_example6[-4:-2:]\n\n[1, 5]\n\n\nAn extra colon (‘:’) can be used to slice every ith element of a list.\n\n#Selecting every 3rd element of a list\nlist_example6[::3]\n\n[4, 5, 5]\n\n\n\n#Selecting every 3rd element of a list from the end\nlist_example6[::-3]\n\n[5, 1, 3]\n\n\n\n#Selecting every element of a list from the end or reversing a list \nlist_example6[::-1]\n\n[5, 87, 5, 1, 7, 5, 3, 7, 4]\n\n\n\n\n5.2.7 Practice exercise 4\nStart with the list [8,9,10]. Do the following:\n\n5.2.7.1 \nSet the second entry (index 1) to 17\n\nL = [8,9,10]\nL[1]=17\n\n\n\n5.2.7.2 \nAdd 4, 5, and 6 to the end of the list\n\nL = L+[4,5,6]\n\n\n\n5.2.7.3 \nRemove the first entry from the list\n\nL.pop(0)\n\n8\n\n\n\n\n5.2.7.4 \nSort the list\n\nL.sort()\n\n\n\n5.2.7.5 \nDouble the list (concatenate the list to itself)\n\nL=L+L\n\n\n\n5.2.7.6 \nInsert 25 at index 3\nThe final list should equal [4,5,6,25,10,17,4,5,6,10,17]\n\nL.insert(3,25)\nL\n\n[4, 5, 6, 25, 10, 17, 4, 5, 6, 10, 17]\n\n\nNow that we have an idea about lists, let us try to think where it can be used.\n\n\n\n\n\n \n        \n\n\nNow that we have learned about lists and tuples, let us compare them.\n\\(\\color{red}{\\text{Q2}}\\): A list seems to be much more flexible than tuple, and can replace a tuple almost everywhere. Then why use tuple at all?\n\\(\\color{blue}{\\text{A2}}\\): The additional flexibility of a list comes at the cost of efficiency. Some of the advatages of a tuple over a list are as follows:\n\nSince a list can be extended, space is over-allocated when creating a list. A tuple takes less storage space as compared to a list of the same length.\nTuples are not copied. If a tuple is assigned to another tuple, both tuples point to the same memory location. However, if a list is assigned to another list, a new list is created consuming the same memory space as the orignial list.\nTuples refer to their element directly, while in a list, there is an extra layer of pointers that refers to their elements. Thus it is faster to retrieve elements from a tuple.\n\nThe examples below illustrate the above advantages of a tuple.\n\n#Example showing tuples take less storage space than lists for the same elements\ntuple_ex = (1, 2, 'Obama')\nlist_ex = [1, 2, 'Obama']\nprint(\"Space taken by tuple =\",tuple_ex.__sizeof__(),\" bytes\")\nprint(\"Space taken by list =\",list_ex.__sizeof__(),\" bytes\")\n\nSpace taken by tuple = 48  bytes\nSpace taken by list = 64  bytes\n\n\n\n#Examples showing that a tuples are not copied, while lists can be copied\ntuple_copy = tuple(tuple_ex)\nprint(\"Is tuple_copy same as tuple_ex?\", tuple_ex is tuple_copy)\nlist_copy = list(list_ex)\nprint(\"Is list_copy same as list_ex?\",list_ex is list_copy)\n\nIs tuple_copy same as tuple_ex? True\nIs list_copy same as list_ex? False\n\n\n\n#Examples showing tuples takes lesser time to retrieve elements\nimport time as tm\ntt = tm.time()\nlist_ex = list(range(1000000)) #List containinig whole numbers upto 1 million\na=(list_ex[::-2])\nprint(\"Time take to retrieve every 2nd element from a list = \", tm.time()-tt)\n\ntt = tm.time()\ntuple_ex = tuple(range(1000000)) #tuple containinig whole numbers upto 1 million\na=(tuple_ex[::-2])\nprint(\"Time take to retrieve every 2nd element from a tuple = \", tm.time()-tt)\n\nTime take to retrieve every 2nd element from a list =  0.03579902648925781\nTime take to retrieve every 2nd element from a tuple =  0.02684164047241211"

    "text": "5.3 Dictionary\nA dictionary consists of key-value pairs, where the keys and values are python objects. While values can be any python object, keys need to be immutable python objects, like strings, integers, tuples, etc. Thus, a list can be a value, but not a key, as elements of list can be changed. A dictionary is defined using the keyword dict along with curly braces, colons to separate keys and values, and commas to separate elements of a dictionary:\n\ndict_example = {'USA':'Joe Biden', 'India':'Narendra Modi', 'China':'Xi Jinping'}\n\nElements of a dictionary can be retrieved by using the corresponding key.\n\ndict_example['India']\n\n'Narendra Modi'\n\n\n\n5.3.1 Adding and removing elements in a dictionary\nNew elements can be added to a dictionary by defining a key in square brackets and assiging it to a value:\n\ndict_example['Japan'] = 'Fumio Kishida'\ndict_example['Countries'] = 4\ndict_example\n\n{'USA': 'Joe Biden',\n 'India': 'Narendra Modi',\n 'China': 'Xi Jinping',\n 'Japan': 'Fumio Kishida',\n 'Countries': 4}\n\n\nElements can be removed from the dictionary using the del method or the pop method:\n\n#Removing the element having key as 'Countries'\ndel dict_example['Countries']\n\n\ndict_example\n\n{'USA': 'Joe Biden',\n 'India': 'Narendra Modi',\n 'China': 'Xi Jinping',\n 'Japan': 'Fumio Kishida'}\n\n\n\n#Removing the element having key as 'USA'\ndict_example.pop('USA')\n\n'Joe Biden'\n\n\n\ndict_example\n\n{'India': 'Narendra Modi', 'China': 'Xi Jinping', 'Japan': 'Fumio Kishida'}\n\n\nNew elements can be added, and values of exisiting keys can be changed using the update method:\n\ndict_example = {'USA':'Joe Biden', 'India':'Narendra Modi', 'China':'Xi Jinping','Countries':3}\ndict_example\n\n{'USA': 'Joe Biden',\n 'India': 'Narendra Modi',\n 'China': 'Xi Jinping',\n 'Countries': 3}\n\n\n\ndict_example.update({'Countries':4, 'Japan':'Fumio Kishida'})\n\n\ndict_example\n\n{'USA': 'Joe Biden',\n 'India': 'Narendra Modi',\n 'China': 'Xi Jinping',\n 'Countries': 4,\n 'Japan': 'Fumio Kishida'}\n\n\n\n\n5.3.2 Iterating over elements of a dictionary\nThe items() attribute of a dictionary can be used to iterate over elements of a dictionary.\n\nfor key,value in dict_example.items():\n    print(\"The Head of State of\",key,\"is\",value)\n\nThe Head of State of USA is Joe Biden\nThe Head of State of India is Narendra Modi\nThe Head of State of China is Xi Jinping\nThe Head of State of Countries is 4\nThe Head of State of Japan is Fumio Kishida\n\n\n\n\n5.3.3 Practice exercise 5\nThe GDP per capita of USA for most years from 1960 to 2021 is given by the dictionary D given in the code cell below.\nFind:\n\nThe GDP per capita in 2015\nThe GDP per capita of 2014 is missing.

    "text": "5.4 Functions\nIf an algorithm or block of code is being used several times in a code, then it can be separately defined as a function. This makes the code more organized and readable. For example, let us define a function that prints prime numbers between a and b, and returns the number of prime numbers found.\n\n#Function definition\ndef prime_numbers (a,b=100):\n    num_prime_nos = 0\n    \n    #Iterating over all numbers between a and b\n    for i in range(a,b):\n        num_divisors=0\n        \n        #Checking if the ith number has any factors\n        for j in range(2, i):\n            if i%j == 0:\n                num_divisors=1;break;\n                \n        #If there are no factors, then printing and counting the number as prime        \n        if num_divisors==0:\n            print(i)\n            num_prime_nos = num_prime_nos+1\n            \n    #Return count of the number of prime numbers\n    return num_prime_nos\n\nIn the above function, the keyword def is used to define the function, prime_numbers is the name of the function, a and b are the arguments that the function uses to compute the output.\nLet us use the defined function to print and count the prime numbers between 40 and 60.\n\n#Printing prime numbers between 40 and 60\nnum_prime_nos_found = prime_numbers(40,60)\n\n41\n43\n47\n53\n59\n\n\n\nnum_prime_nos_found\n\n5\n\n\nIf the user calls the function without specifying the value of the argument b, then it will take the default value of 100, as mentioned in the function definition. However, for the argument a, the user will need to specify a value, as there is no value defined as a default value in the function definition.\n\n5.4.1 Global and local variables with respect to a function\nA variable defined within a function is local to that function, while a variable defined outside the function is global to that function. In case a variable with the same name is defined both outside and inside a function, it will refer to its global value outside the function and local value within the function.\nThe example below shows a variable with the name var referring to its local value when called within the function, and global value when called outside the function.\n\nvar = 5\ndef sample_function(var):    \n    print(\"Local value of 'var' within 'sample_function()'= \",var)\n\nsample_function(4)\nprint(\"Global value of 'var' outside 'sample_function()' = \",var)\n\nLocal value of 'var' within 'sample_function()'=  4\nGlobal value of 'var' outside 'sample_function()' =  5\n\n\n\n\n5.4.2 Practice exercise 6\nThe object deck defined below corresponds to a deck of cards. Estimate the probablity that a five card hand will be a flush, as follows:\n\nWrite a function that accepts a hand of 5 cards as argument, and returns whether the hand is a flush or not.\nRandomly pull a hand of 5 cards from the deck. Call the function developed in (1) to determine if the hand is a flush.\nRepeat (2) 10,000 times.\nEstimate the probability of the hand being a flush from the results of the 10,000 simulations.\n\nYou may use the function shuffle() from the random library to shuffle the deck everytime before pulling a hand of 5 cards.\n\ndeck = [{'value':i, 'suit':c}\nfor c in ['spades', 'clubs', 'hearts', 'diamonds']\nfor i in range(2,15)]\n\nSolution:\n\nimport random as rm\n\n#Function to check if a 5-card hand is a flush\ndef chck_flush(hands):  \n    \n    #Assuming that the hand is a flush, before checking the cards\n    yes_flush =1\n    \n    #Storing the suit of the first card in 'first_suit'\n    first_suit = hands[0]['suit']\n    \n    #Iterating over the remaining 4 cards of the hand\n    for j in range(1,len(hands)):\n        \n        #If the suit of any of the cards does not match the suit of the first card, the hand is not a flush\n        if first_suit!=hands[j]['suit']:\n            yes_flush = 0; \n            \n            #As soon as a card with a different suit is found, the hand is not a flush and there is no need to check other cards. So, we 'break' out of the loop\n            break;\n    return yes_flush\n\nflush=0\nfor i in range(10000):\n    \n    #Shuffling the deck\n    rm.shuffle(deck)\n    \n    #Picking out the first 5 cards of the deck as a hand and checking if they are a flush\n    #If the hand is a flush it is counted\n    flush=flush+chck_flush(deck[0:5])\n    \nprint(\"Probability of obtaining a flush=\", 100*(flush/10000),\"%\")\n\nProbability of obtaining a flush= 0.2 %"

    "text": "6.2 Class\nA class is a template for objects. It contains the attributes and methods associated with the object of the class. As an analaogy, the class Cat will consist of characterisitcs (or attributes) shared by all cats such as breed, fur color, etc., as well as capability to perform functions (or methods) such as run, meow, etc.\nInstance: An instance is a specific realization of the object of a particular class. Continuing with the Cat analaogy of a class, a particular cat is an instance of the class Cat. Similarly, in the example above, the object integer_example is an instance of the class integer. The words object and instance are often used interchangeably.\nCreating an instance of a class is called Instantiation.\n\n6.2.1 Creating your own class\nUntil now we saw examples of in-built Python classes, such as integer, List, etc. Now, we’ll learn to create our own class that serves our purpose.\nBelow is a toy example of a class.\n\nclass ToyClass:\n    def __init__(self, x, y):\n        self.x = x\n        self.y = y\n    \n    def add(self):\n        return self.x + self.y\n    \n    def multiply(self):\n        return self.x*self.y\n\nWe’ll use the example above to explain the following terms:\n\nThe class statement: We use the class statement to create a class. The Python style guide recommends to use CamelCase for class names.\nThe constructor (or the __init__() method): A class typically has a method called __init__. This method is called a constructor and is automatically called when an object or instance of the class is created. The constructor initializes the attributes of the class. In the above example, the constructor accepts two values as arguments, and initializes its attributes x and y with those values.\nThe self argument: This is the first argument to every method in the class. Whenever the class refers to one of its attributes or methods, it must precede them by self. The purpose of self is to distinguish the class’s attributes and methods from other variables and functions in the program.\n\nThe class ToyClass consists of two attributes x and y, a constructor __init__(), and two methods add() and multiply().\nTo create an object or instance of the class ToyClass, we’ll use the class name with the values to be passed as argument to the constructor for initializing the object / instance.\n\ntoy_instance = ToyClass(6,12)\n\nThe x attribute of the class ToyClass can be called using the . operator with the object name:\n\ntoy_instance.x\n\n6\n\n\nTo use the multiply() method of the class ToyClass, we’ll use the . operator with the object name:\n\ntoy_instance.multiply()\n\n72\n\n\n\n\n6.2.2 Example: A class that analyzes a string\nLet us create a class that analyzes a string.\n\nclass AnalyzeString:\n    \n    #Constructor\n    def __init__(self, s):\n        s = s.lower()\n        self.words = s.split()\n    \n    #This method counts the numebr of words\n    def number_of_words(self):\n        return (len(self.words))\n    \n    #This method counts the number of words starting with the string s\n    def starts_with(self,s):\n        return len([x for x in self.words if x[:len(s)]==s])\n    \n    #This method counts the number of words of length n\n    def words_with_length(self,n):\n        return len([x for x in self.words if len(x)==n])\n    \n    #This method returns the frequency of the word w\n    def word_frequency(self,w):\n        return self.words.count(w)\n\nLet us create an instance of the class AnalyzeString() to analyze a sentence.\n\n#Defining a string\nsentence = 'This sentence in an example of a string that we will analyse using a class we have defined'\n\n\n#Creating an instance of class AnalyzeString()\nsentence_analysis = AnalyzeString(sentence)\n\n\n#The attribute 'word' contains the list of words in the sentence\nsentence_analysis.words\n\n['this',\n 'sentence',\n 'in',\n 'an',\n 'example',\n 'of',\n 'a',\n 'string',\n 'that',\n 'we',\n 'will',\n 'analyse',\n 'using',\n 'a',\n 'class',\n 'we',\n 'have',\n 'defined']\n\n\n\n#The method 'word_frequncy()' provides the frequency of a word in the sentence\nsentnce_analysis.word_frequency('we')\n\n2\n\n\n\n#The method 'starts_with()' provides the frequency of number of words starting with a particular string\nsentnce_analysis.starts_with('th')\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n6.2.3 Practice exercise 1\nWrite a class called PasswordManager. The class should have a list called old_passwords that holds all of the user’s past passwords. The last item of the list is the user’s current password. There should be a method called get_password that returns the current password and a method called set_password that sets the user’s password. The set_password method should only change the password if the attempted password is different from all the user’s past passwords. It should either print ‘Password changed successfully!’, or ‘Old password cannot be reused, try again.’ Finally, create a method called is_correct that receives a string and returns a boolean True or False depending on whether the string is equal to the current password or not.\nTo initialize the object of the class, use the list below.\nAfter defining the class:\n\nCheck the attribute old_passwords\nCheck the method get_password()\nTry re-setting the password to ‘ibiza1972’, and then check the current password.\nTry re-setting the password to ‘oktoberfest2022’, and then check the current password.\nCheck the is_correct() method\n\n\npast_passwords = ['titanic1911','ibiza1972','montecarlo799']\n\n\nclass PasswordManager:\n    def __init__(self,past_passwords):\n        self.old_passwords = past_passwords\n        \n    def get_password(self):\n        return self.old_passwords[len(self.old_passwords)-1]\n    \n    def set_password(self,new_password):\n        if new_password not in self.old_passwords:\n            self.old_passwords.append(new_password)\n            print(\"Password changed!\")\n        else:\n            print(\"Old password cannot be reused, try again.\")\n            \n    def is_correct(self,password):\n        if password == self.old_passwords[len(self.old_passwords)-1]:\n            return True\n        return False\n\npasswd = PasswordManager(past_passwords)"

    "section": "6.3 Inheritance",
    "text": "6.3 Inheritance\nIn object-oriented programming there is a concept called inheritance where we can create a new class that builds off of another class. The new class gets all of the variables and methods of the class it is inheriting from (called the base class). It can then define additional variables and methods that are not present in the base class, and it can also override some of the methods of the base class. That is, it can rewrite them to suit its own purposes. Here is a simple example:\n\nclass Parent:\n    \n    def __init__(self, a, b):\n        self.a = a\n        \n    def method1(self):\n        return self.a+' should study!'\n    \n    def method2(self):\n        return self.a+' does not study enough '\n\nclass Child(Parent):\n    \n    def __init__(self, a,b):\n        self.a = a\n        self.b = b\n        \n    def method1(self):\n        return self.a+' should play with ' + self.b\n    \n    def method3(self):\n        return self.a + ' does not play enough'\n\nNote that when inheriting from a class, we indicate the parent class in parentheses in the class statement.\nWe see that method1 is present in both the Parent and Child classes, while method2 is only present in the Parent class. Let us understand how does the Child class use the methods of the Parent class, and what happens if a method with the same name is present in both the parent and child classes.\n\np = Parent('Sam', 'John')\nc = Child('Sam','Pam')\nprint('Parent method 1: ', p.method1())\nprint('Parent method 2: ', p.method2())\nprint()\nprint('Child method 1: ', c.method1())\nprint('Child method 2: ', c.method2())\nprint('Child method 3: ', c.method3())\n\nParent method 1:  Sam should study!\nParent method 2:  Sam does not study enough \n\nChild method 1:  Sam should play with Pam\nChild method 2:  Sam does not study enough \nChild method 3:  Sam does not play enough\n\n\nWe see in the example above that the child has overridden the parent’s method1. The child has inherited the parent’s method2, so it can use it without having to define it. The child also adds some features to the parent class, namely a new variable b and a new method, method3.\n\n6.3.1 Practice exercise 2\nDefine a class that inherits the in-built Python class list, and adds a new method to the class called nunique() which returns the number of unique elements in the list.\nDefine the following list as an object of the class you created. Then:\n\nFind the number of unique elements in the object using the method nunique() of the inherited class.\nCheck if the pop() method of the parent class works to pop an element out of the object.\n\n\nlist_ex = [1,2,5,3,6,5,5,5,12]\n\n\nclass list_v2(list):\n    def nuinque(self):\n        unique_elements = []\n        for x in self:\n            if x not in unique_elements:\n                unique_elements.append(x)\n        return len(unique_elements)\n    \nlist_ex = list_v2(list_ex)\nprint(\"Number of unique elements = \", list_ex.nuinque())\nprint(\"Checking the pop() method, the popped out element is\", list_ex.pop())\n\nNumber of unique elements =  6\nChecking the pop() method, the popped out element is 12\n\n\n\n\n6.3.2 Practice exercise 3\nDefine a class named PasswordManagerUpdated that inherits the class PasswordManager defined in Practice exercise 1. The class PasswordManagerUpdated should have two methods, other than the constructor:\n\nThe method set_password() that sets a new password. The new password must only be accepted if it does not have any punctuations in it, and if it is not the same as one of the old passwords. If the new password is not acceptable, then one of the appropriate messages should be printed - (a) Cannot have punctuation in password, try again, or (b) Old password cannot be reused, try again.\nThe method suggest_password() that randomly sets and returns a password as a string comprising of 15 randomly chosen letters. Letters may be repeated as well."

Write a function that accepts a word, say word_to_search and the tuple_of_words as arguments, and finds if the word_to_search occurs in the tuple_of_words or not. This is very simple to do with the code word_to_search in tuple_of_words. However, this code is unfortunately very slow.\nAs the words in the tuple_of_words are already sorted in alphabetical order, we can search using a faster way, called binary search. To implement binary search in a function, start by comparing word_to_search with the middle entry in the tuple_of_words. If they are equal, then you are done and the function should return True. On the other hand, if the word_to_search comes before the middle entry, then search the first half of tuple_of_words. If it comes after the middle entry, then search the second half of tuple_of_words. Then repeat the process on the appropriate half of the tuple_of_words and continue until the word is found or there is nothing left to search, in which case the function short return False.

Use the lists below to initialize the attributes of the class.\nEach message will be tagged as spam, update, or personal as follows. If the message contains any word / phrase in the list spam_words, then it will be tagged as spam. If the messege is not tagged as spam, and it contains any word / phrase in the list update_words, then it will be tagged as update. If the message has not been tagged as spam or update, then it will be tagged as personal.

This is because the model has one more parameter to tune to reduce the residual squared error (RSS). However, the p-value of rand_col suggests that its coefficient is zero. Thus, using the model with rand_col may give poorer performance on unknown data, as compared to the model without rand_col. This implies that it is not a good idea to blindly add variables in the model to increase R-squared."

For example, the muliple linear regression model that we developed in Chapter 2 assumes that the average increase in price associated with a unit increase in engineSize is always $12,180, regardless of the value of other predictors. However, this assumption may be incorrect.\n\n\nWe can relax this assumption by considering another predictor, called an interaction term. Let us assume that the average increase in price associated with a one-unit increase in engineSize depends on the model year of the car. In other words, there is an interaction between engineSize and year. This interaction can be included as a predictor, which is the product of engineSize and year. Note that there are several possible interactions that we can consider. Here the interaction between engineSize and year is just an example.\n\n#Considering interaction between engineSize and year\nols_object = smf.ols(formula = 'price~year*engineSize+mileage+mpg', data = train)\nmodel = ols_object.fit()\nmodel.summary()\n\n\n\nOLS Regression Results\n\n  Dep.

No.           7.66e+07 \n\nNotes:[1] Standard Errors assume that the covariance matrix of the errors is correctly specified.[2] The condition number is large, 7.66e+07. This might indicate that there arestrong multicollinearity or other numerical problems.\n\n\nNote that the R-squared has increased as compared to the model in Chapter 2 since we added a predictor.\nThe model equation is:\n\\[\\begin{equation}\nprice = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1*year + \\beta_2*engineSize + \\beta_3*(year * engineSize) + \\beta4*mileage + \\beta_5*mpg,\n\\end{equation}\\]or\n\\[\\begin{equation}\nprice = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1*year + (\\beta_2+\\beta_3*year)*engineSize + \\beta4*mileage + \\beta_5*mpg,\n\\end{equation}\\]or\n\\[\\begin{equation}\nprice = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1*year + \\tilde \\beta*engineSize + \\beta4*mileage + \\beta_5*mpg,\n\\end{equation}\\]\nSince \\(\\tilde \\beta\\) is a function of year, the association between engineSize and price is no longer a constant. A change in the value of year will change the association between price and engineSize.\nSubstituting the values of the coefficients: \\[\\begin{equation}\nprice = 5.606e5 - 275.3833*year + (-1.796e6+896.7687*year)*engineSize -0.1525*mileage -84.3417*mpg\n\\end{equation}\\]\nThus, for cars launched in the year 2010, the average increase in price for one liter increase in engine size is -1.796e6 + 896.7687 * 2010 \\(\\approx\\) \\$6,500, assuming all the other predictors are constant. However, for cars launched in the year 2020, the average increase in price for one liter increase in engine size is -1.796e6 + 896.7687*2020 \\(\\approx\\) \\$15,500 , assuming all the other predictors are constant.\nSimilarly, the equation can be re-arranged as: \\[\\begin{equation}\nprice = 5.606e5 +(-275.3833+896.7687*engineSize)*year -1.796e6*engineSize -0.1525*mileage -84.3417*mpg\n\\end{equation}\\]\nThus, for cars with an engine size of 2 litres, the average increase in price for a one year newer model is -275.3833+896.7687 * 2 \\(\\approx\\) \\$1500, assuming all the other predictors are constant. However, for cars with an engine size of 3 litres, the average increase in price for a one year newer model is -275.3833+896.7687 * 3 \\(\\approx\\) \\$2400, assuming all the other predictors are constant.\n\n#Computing the RMSE of the model with the interaction term\npred_price = model.predict(testf)\nnp.sqrt(((testp.price - pred_price)**2).mean())\n\n9423.598872501092\n\n\nNote that the RMSE reduced as compared to that of the model in Chapter 2. This is because the interaction term between engineSize and year is significant and relaxes the assumption of constant association between price and engine size, and between price and year. This added flexibility makes the model better fit the data. Caution: Too much flexibility may lead to overfitting!\nNote that interaction terms corresponding to other variable pairs, and higher order interaction terms (such as those containing 3 or 4 variables) may also be significant and improve the model fit & thereby the prediction accuracy of the model.\n\n\n\nLet us develop a model for predicting price based on engineSize and the qualitative predictor transmission.\n\n#checking the distribution of values of transmission\ntrain.transmission.value_counts()\n\nManual       1948\nAutomatic    1660\nSemi-Auto    1351\nOther           1\nName: transmission, dtype: int64\n\n\nNote that the Other category of the variable transmission contains only a single observation, which is likely to be insufficient to train the model.

This represents a potentially serious limitation of the model, since in fact a change in engine size may have a very different association on the price of an automatic car versus a semi-automatic or manual car.\nThis limitation can be addressed by adding an interaction variable by multiplying engineSize with the dummy variables for semi-automatic and manual transmissions.\n\n#Using the ols function to create an ols object.
